This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: the absence of proper error handling within asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express app with an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) that may throw an error.  Crucially, it does not handle this error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version. This problem can manifest silently and is especially problematic in production environments where it can lead to unpredictable behavior and difficulties in debugging.  The solution involves using either a `try...catch` block or `.catch` for promise rejections to gracefully handle potential errors and return appropriate responses to the client.
